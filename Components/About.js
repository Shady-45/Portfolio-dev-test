            Hello, my name is Rahul, and I'm a student at Chennai's Dr. MGR
            Educational and Research Institute studying electronics and
            communication engineering.Â 
          </p>

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I attended Bethany School in Visakhapatnam for my formal education.
            I came to Chennai for my higher education after spending the
            majority of my youth there. I began studying HTML and CSS during the
            lockdown, which sparked my interest in coding.In my spare time, I
            try to programme the logos of well-known corporations using Codepen.
